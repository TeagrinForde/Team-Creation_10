# Team-Creation_10
This application generates a webpage that displays our team's basic information such as emails and GitHub username profiles.
It will go through a series of prompts to collect the manager's name, id, email, and office number; followed by the option of adding engineers, interns, or finalizing the team.
Engineers will submit their name, email, id and github username while interns will input their name, id, email and school.

Once the user completes their team, an html file is generated in the locat dist folder. Watch the video below for detailed instructions.
